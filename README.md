# vCaffe
Visualize log file produced by the caffe deep learning framework. Try it at http://rogerchern.github.io/

## Usage
Just open the visualizeLog.htm in Chrome (other browser might be OK, but I didn't test them)

## Log file format
Your output blob should have name `loss` and `accuracy`. Otherwise it will not work.
