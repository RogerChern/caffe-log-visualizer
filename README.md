# vCaffe
Visualize log file produced by the caffe deep learning framework. Try it at http://rogerchern.github.io/vcaffe. An example is available at http://rogerchern.github.io/vcaffe/#/gist/62be7fbde0355ec649081756177b4b3b

## Usage
Just open the visualizeLog.htm in Chrome (other browser might be OK, but I didn't test on them) and drag your log file to it.

## Log file format
Your output blob should have name `loss` and `accuracy`. Otherwise it will not work.
